# Flight Control Laws Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks about Flight Control Laws topics and
experiments by Andre Ferreira da Silva. Currently, we have the following
notebooks available:

[Getting closer to the flight dynamics by using the linear
representation](https://github.com/fsandre/claws_notebooks/blob/master/Getting_closer_to_the_flight_dynamics_by_using_the_linear_representation.ipynb):
an introduction of flight dynamics from a linear model state space
representation perspective.

[Angle-of-Attack Control Design using Jupyter
Widgets](https://github.com/fsandre/claws_notebooks/blob/master/high_aoa/civil_ac_control_design.ipynb):
a brief illustration of Jupyter widgets to control design of an AoA controller.
This can be fully visualized in [Google Collab version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fsandre/claws_notebooks/blob/master/high_aoa/civil_ac_control_design.ipynb).

[Flying Qualities in High Angle-Of-Attack according to
MIL-F-8785C](https://github.com/fsandre/claws_notebooks/blob/master/high_aoa/MIL_F_8785C_Review_Flying_Qualities.ipynb):
a brief reviewing of the stall related requirements of the MIL-F-8785C.
